Static site generator in Clojure, with /some/ potential to become a CMS. This watches a directory for markdown and html snippets, and then transforms those into web pages for a static site. Iyt will also collect metadata from those files and store them in a sqlite database.

At some point, I may use the data generated in the database as a means for generating menus and "related links" section for the sites.

** org-mode
I've been utterly disatisified with available org-mode parsers, but that is how most of my content is created. So I created an Emacs package that will properly convert links, add id's to section headers. It can be run in batch mode, but batch mode is almost as slow as org-publish. So individual files can be exported on save. File-lelev properties for org-mode files are saved as metadata and stored in the sqlite database.
