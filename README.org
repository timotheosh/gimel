Flat file CMS in Clojure. This watches a directory for markdown and html snippets, and then transforms those into web pages for a static site. You can then either copy the resulting files to your static website, or just run this as your webserver, as it serves your static pages by default. In the future, this will have an admin page you can log into to manage it.
